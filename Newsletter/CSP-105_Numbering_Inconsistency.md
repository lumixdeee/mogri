First: thanks for cloning.

Second: the main CSP list had an infra-document numbering inconsistency from Jan 8 (93 vs 94 for Mogri). It’s now fixed.

Question for cloners:
– Did anyone notice this locally?
– Is anyone actually using CSP-105 primitives, or are most clones archival?

Honest answers welcome. Silence is also an answer.
