This list is incomplete and mogritious

How much is mogri?
Good question. According to my robot, QA'ed by me:
Mogri is one of 105 'semantic primes/primitives' as identified by chatGPT 5.2
By this measure, it's just under 1%. However, it's not. Not all primitives are  
equal, and mogri will almost certainly have less share of the total semantic  
load of the english speaking world than would, say, time, you, that, fact, being, etc.

So we turn to the robot to try to estimate how many people worldwide could use  
mogri or equivalent, figure out the savings from using it as much as possible  
and estimate how many person work units that replaces.

Between ~0.5 million and 9 million approx
Roughly equivalent to saving between a 1000th and a 20,000th
or 0.05% to 0.1% of effort, which isn't 1%, but is rather a lot

If it were mapped onto $100 Trillion of GDP (which we shouldn't),
that's just $5-100 Billion per year. So that's how much mogri is, in a mogricious sense.


How fast is mogri?
Same as max fps of reality i.e. planc lengths light goes per second in a vacuum
We are sorry, we cannot go any faster than this.  


How many people / languages could benefit from mogri?  
(tbc)


how tall is mogri?  
Eleven and a pi'th imptric decinches  
(a pi'th=pi^-1)  
(imptric=(met+imp)/2)
(decinch=10inch)
