====================

Language: Hindi
ISO code: hi
Native speakers consulted: everyday + grammatical usage
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- everyday
- literary

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Hindi have a neutral lexical carrier for persistence-through-change?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- बनना (ban-nā)
- होना (honā)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- ban-nā implies becoming-into a state
- honā implies being, not persistence-through-change
- both rely on light-verb constructions that imply endpoints

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- light verb constructions
- aspectual particles
- contextual framing

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Medium to high

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Hindi expresses change relationally via verb compounds rather than
a single neutral carrier.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
