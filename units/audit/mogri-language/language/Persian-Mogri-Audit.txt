Native speakers consulted: poetic / everyday usage
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- everyday
- literary
- poetic

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Persian lexicalise persistence-through-change neutrally?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- شدن (shodan)
- دگرگون شدن (degargun shodan)
- گشتن (gashtan)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- shodan implies becoming-into
- degargun shodan implies transformation
- gashtan is archaic / poetic
- strong metaphorical loading

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- poetic metaphor
- narrative progression
- aspectual phrasing

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Medium (absorbed by poetry)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Persian prefers metaphor over abstraction; mogri would flatten tone.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
☑ Lexicalisation discouraged
