CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Wu Chinese lexicalise persistence-through-change neutrally?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- 变 (biã)
- 成 (zen)
- 化 (ho)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- imply change events or becoming-into
- heavy reliance on aspect and context
- no neutral carrier independent of situation

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- aspectual particles
- serial verbs
- contextual inference

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Low

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

☑ Lexicalisation discouraged
