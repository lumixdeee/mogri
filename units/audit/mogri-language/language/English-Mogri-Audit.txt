English-Mogri-Audit.txt
======================

Language: English
ISO code: en
Native speakers consulted: implicit (native usage + long philosophical record)
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- everyday
- literary
- technical
- philosophical

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does English have a single, ordinary lexical item that carries
persistence-through-change without endpoint, identity swap, or teleology?

Assessment:
Partially, but not fully lexicalised.

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- transmogrify
  register: comic / archaic
  everyday usage: no

- -ify (productive suffix)
  register: technical / procedural
  everyday usage: yes (limited)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- transmogrify is quarantined as humorous or grotesque
- -ify verbs imply operation toward an outcome
- no neutral, general-purpose carrier
- requires paraphrase to remain non-teleological

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- progressive aspect ("is becoming", "kept being")
- gerunds ("the becoming of")
- adverbial hedging ("still", "in the middle of")
- metaphor stacking

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Medium to high (verbosity and repetition in philosophy)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? latent

NOTES
-----
English has long possessed the morphological machinery for mogri
(transmogrify, -ify), but expansion into a neutral everyday carrier
was historically constrained by tone and register.

STATUS
------
☐ Still missing mogri
☑ Mogri latent (via transmogrify / -ify lineage)
☐ Lexicalisation discouraged
