ISO code: lzh
Native speakers consulted: historical / scholarly tradition

Register scope:
- literary
- philosophical
- historical

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Classical Chinese lexicalise persistence-through-change as a neutral carrier?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- 變 (biàn)
- 化 (huà)
- 行 (xíng)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- biàn implies a change event
- huà implies transformation
- xíng implies action or conduct
- meaning emerges relationally, not lexically

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- juxtaposition
- omission
- parallelism
- contextual resonance across lines

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Low (absorbed by textual minimalism)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Classical Chinese deliberately avoids lexical pinning.
Persistence-through-change is carried by structure, not words.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
☑ Lexicalisation discouraged
