Sanskrit-Mogri-Audit.txt
=======================

Language: Sanskrit
ISO code: sa
Native speakers consulted: grammatical / philosophical tradition
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- literary
- philosophical
- technical (śāstra)

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Sanskrit provide a neutral lexical carrier for persistence-through-change?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- भवति (bhavati)
- भव (bhava)
- परिवर्तन (pariṇāma)
- विकार (vikāra)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- bhavati implies becoming or coming-into-being
- bhava implies state or mode of being
- pariṇāma implies transformation with outcome
- vikāra implies alteration or distortion

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- aspectual verb usage
- nominal abstraction
- metaphysical framing (prakṛti / puruṣa distinctions)
- layered commentary (bhāṣya tradition)

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
High (philosophical elaboration and commentary dependence)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Sanskrit philosophy repeatedly reconstructs persistence-through-change
via metaphysical systems rather than a neutral carrier.
Change is systematised, not lexicalised.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
☑ Lexicalisation discouraged
