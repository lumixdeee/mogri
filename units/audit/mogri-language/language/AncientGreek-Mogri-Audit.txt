============================

Language: Ancient Greek
ISO code: grc
Native speakers consulted: philosophical canon

Register scope:

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Ancient Greek have a neutral lexical carrier for persistence-through-change?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- γίγνεσθαι (gignesthai)
- μεταβολή (metabolē)
- κίνησις (kinēsis)
- γένεσις (genesis)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- gignesthai implies coming-into-being
- metabolē implies change between states
- kinēsis implies motion as category
- genesis implies origin or birth

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- aspectual verb usage
- metaphysical categorisation (being vs becoming)
- extended argumentation
- paradox framing (Heraclitus / Parmenides tension)

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Very high (entire philosophical traditions built around it)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Ancient Greek philosophy is largely structured around managing the
absence of a neutral persistence-through-change carrier.
The being/becoming split is a direct consequence.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
