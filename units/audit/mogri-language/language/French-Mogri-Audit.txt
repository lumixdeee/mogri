CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does French have a single neutral lexical carrier for persistence-through-change?

- métamorphose
- néantisation

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- devenir implies direction
- transformation implies operation
- métamorphose implies identity swap
- néantisation is technical and defensive

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- reflexive verbs (se…)
- nominalisation (-isation)
- elegant ambiguity
- repeated philosophical re-derivation

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
High (masked by stylistic elegance)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

without naming it.

☑ Still missing mogri
