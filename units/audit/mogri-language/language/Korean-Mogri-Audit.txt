=====================

Language: Korean
ISO code: ko
Native speakers consulted: pragmatic / everyday usage
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- everyday
- literary

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Korean lexicalise persistence-through-change as a neutral carrier?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- 되다 (doeda)
- 변하다 (byeonhada)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- 되다 implies becoming-into a state
- 변하다 implies a change event
- auxiliaries imply direction or completion

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- auxiliary verb chains
- aspectual endings
- contextual ellipsis

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Low to medium (distributed across grammar)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Korean handles continuity through grammatical layering rather than
lexical primitives.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
☑ Lexicalisation discouraged
