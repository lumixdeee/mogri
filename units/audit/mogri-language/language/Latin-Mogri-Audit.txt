Native speakers consulted: textual / academic tradition
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- literary
- philosophical
- technical

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Latin possess a neutral lexical carrier for persistence-through-change?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- fieri
- mutatio
- transformatio
- processus

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- fieri implies becoming or coming to be
- mutatio implies change between states
- transformatio implies reshaping
- processus reifies into a thing

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- periphrastic verb constructions
- participial phrases
- abstract noun stacking
- rhetorical elaboration

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
High (verbosity and formalism)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Latin philosophical prose expands heavily to keep motion alive.
The absence of a neutral carrier propagates into later European traditions.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
