Mogri Language Audit
-------------------

Overview
--------
This folder contains audit records assessing whether major world
languages possess a native lexical equivalent to “mogri” — a neutral
carrier for persistence-through-change without endpoint, identity
swap, teleology, or moral loading.

Each language is recorded in an individual file using a consistent,
lightweight template.

What Is Being Assessed
----------------------
The audit asks a narrow question:

Does the language have a single, ordinary lexical item that can carry:
- continuity through change
- change without a start or end event
- motion without a goal
- persistence without identity

The answer may be:
- yes (rare)
- no
- or no, and lexicalisation is discouraged

What the Audit Is Not
---------------------
- It is not a value judgement on languages.
- It is not a proposal to reform or “fix” languages.
- It is not a claim that every language needs mogri.

Recording absence is valid data.

Outcome Labels
--------------
- Mogri latent:
  Structural affordances exist but were not historically expanded.

- Still missing mogri:
  No neutral carrier identified; absence recorded descriptively.

- Lexicalisation discouraged:
  Existing linguistic systems already handle the function implicitly;
  introducing a carrier would be counterproductive.

Native Speaker Priority
-----------------------
Native speaker intuition and usage override external analysis.
Disagreement is recorded, not resolved prematurely.

Scope
-----
The audit aims to cover languages representing approximately 99% of the
world’s population.

Status
------
This folder is a record, not a roadmap.

No crusade. No urgency. Just documentation.
