Mogri Language Audit
-------------------

Purpose
-------
This folder tracks whether major world languages possess a native,
ordinary lexical item equivalent to "mogri" — i.e. a neutral carrier for
persistence-through-change without implying endpoint, identity swap,
teleology, or moral loading.

Absence Is a Valid Result
------------------------
Most languages are expected to *lack* a mogri-equivalent.

This is not a failure, deficiency, or gap to be "fixed".
It is empirical data.

Languages routinely compensate using:
- grammatical aspect
- reflexive constructions
- nominalisation
- metaphor
- repetition and re-derivation
- contextual inference

Recording "no equivalent" is often the most accurate outcome.

Do Not Force Candidates
-----------------------
Do not promote a term simply because it:
- feels philosophically close
- appears in dictionaries
- works only in specialist or poetic registers
- requires explanation to prevent misreading
- collapses into state-change, transformation, or becoming-into

A forced candidate corrupts the audit.

If a term:
- is rare,
- technical,
- metaphorical,
- or controversial among native speakers,

then the correct entry is:
"no native mogri-equivalent".

Native Speaker Priority
-----------------------
Native speaker intuition overrides external analysis.
Disagreement should be recorded, not resolved prematurely.

Scope
-----
This audit aims to cover ~100 languages, representing approximately
99% of the world's speakers.

It is descriptive, not prescriptive.

Status Flags
------------
"Still missing mogri" is a stable, acceptable end state.

No crusade. No urgency. Just records.
