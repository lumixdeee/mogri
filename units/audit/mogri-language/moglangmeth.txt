Why “Lexicalisation Discouraged” Is a Positive Outcome
-----------------------------------------------------

This project audits whether world languages possess a native, ordinary
lexical carrier equivalent to “mogri” — a neutral handle for
persistence-through-change without endpoint, identity swap, teleology,
or moral loading.

In many cases, the correct and most accurate outcome is:
“lexicalisation discouraged”.

This is not a failure state.

Why Discouraged Can Be Correct
------------------------------

Languages are not interchangeable storage systems for concepts.
They are evolved ecological systems that distribute meaning across
different mechanisms.

In some languages, introducing a single lexical carrier would:

- duplicate existing grammatical machinery
- interfere with aspectual or derivational systems
- collapse useful ambiguity
- flatten poetic, narrative, or relational meaning
- misrepresent how native speakers actually think and speak

In such cases, *absence is a design feature*.

Three Common Reasons for Discouragement
---------------------------------------

D1 — Context-first languages  
Languages where meaning is primarily carried by context, particles,
omission, or discourse structure. Explicit lexical pinning would
over-specify what is intentionally fluid.

D2 — Aspect or morphology already does the work  
Languages with rich aspectual systems, verb derivation, or agglutination
that already encode persistence-through-change implicitly. Adding a
carrier would be redundant or disruptive.

D3 — Expressive or cultural resistance  
Languages whose traditions privilege narrative, poetic, theological,
or relational framing. Abstract neutral carriers would reduce expressive
power rather than increase clarity.

What This Project Is Not Doing
------------------------------

- It is not claiming that languages are “deficient”.
- It is not proposing that every language should adopt mogri.
- It is not attempting linguistic reform or standardisation.

The audit is descriptive, not prescriptive.

Why This Matters
----------------

Recording “discouraged” outcomes prevents:
- forced or artificial coinages
- conceptual imperialism
- misclassification of healthy linguistic systems as “lacking”

It also strengthens the project’s main claim:
the absence of a neutral lexical carrier is widespread, systematic,
and handled differently across language families.

Status
------
“Lexicalisation discouraged” is a stable, valid, and often optimal end
state in this audit.
