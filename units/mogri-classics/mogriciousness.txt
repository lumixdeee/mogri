mogriciousness
noun

Definition:
The quality of operating as a mogri - a neutral,  
low-signaling container that carries content  
without asserting doctrine, identity, or authority;  
adaptive to context and resistant to cultation.


Usage example:
“The meme’s power came from its mogriciousness,  
it held the idea steady while letting every  
reader project their own meaning into it.”
