mogritus - medical
A light, theatrical affliction observed in early adopters and midnight scribes.  
Presents when a mogri user inhales their own echo and briefly mistakes container for cosmos.  
Meaning swells, usage floods, and the word is sent where a simpler vessel would float just fine.  
Not harmful. Mostly funny. Occasionally productive.  


Observed signs

Overdeployment of mogri in calm sentences 
Warm certainty that mogri solves adjacent, distant, and unrelated matters
Glossary bloom - footnotes sprouting leaves
Social mirroring - others nod, unsure Witch part mattered


Course

Self-limiting. Peaks during high-velocity creation, recedes with sleep, tea, or contact with a non-mogri noun.  
Leaves behind improved discernment and a sharper edge for later use.
Medial advisary


Keep the container visible. Name the contents.


Rotate vocabularies. Let mogri rest between lifts.


Invite friction. A friend who asks “what more?” is sufficient.


If inflation returns, downscale meaning for one paragraph and proceed.


Prognosis
Excellent. Most cases resolve into cleaner language and a better sense of when not to deploy the word.  
Wins arrive sideways for others - clarity spreads while credit thins.
Notes for practitioners
Do not suppress enthusiasm. Channel it. Mogritus is a sign of live systems thinking, briefly mistuned.  
Adjustment, not cure.
