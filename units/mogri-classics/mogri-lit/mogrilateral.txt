# mogrilateral.txt

mogrilateral (adj.)

Describes an agreement, alignment, or understanding whose meaning is
distributed across multiple falsifiable laterals rather than the
apparently agreed terms.

What matters is not what was said, but what would break if taken literally.

Common where:
- silence carries information
- violation is detectable by behaviour
- the visible agreement is not the operative one

If actions contradict expectations, the mogrilateral has been falsified.
No appeal to the surface text is required.
