mogrileteracy (n.)

The adoption of an apparent typo, slip, or error into a new semantic
direction, where the deviation itself becomes informative.

A mistake is not corrected back to baseline,
but explored under constraint to test whether new structure appears.

Distinguished from nonsense by:
- falsifiability
- bounded exploration
- rejection of literal enactment

The joke dies.
The structure may remain.
