------------------------------------------------------------
MOGRI USAGE LEDGER
------------------------------------------------------------

Status: Living, Non-Canonical
Scope: Observed surface usage only
Authority: None (records usage; does not grant validity)

This document records attested uses of Mogri-derived forms that appear
in real discourse (design, tooling, cognitive, or organisational contexts).

Inclusion in this ledger:
- does not imply canonical approval
- does not modify Mogri Grammar Packs
- does not bypass the Extension Policy

This ledger exists to:
- capture semantic pressure
- make gaps visible
- prevent silent drift
- preserve evidence for later evaluation


------------------------------------------------------------
RELATION TO EXTENSION POLICY
------------------------------------------------------------

A form listed here may only graduate to a grammar pack if all extension
criteria are satisfied:

- a genuine semantic gap is demonstrated
- the gap cannot be filled by existing canonical forms
- the form does not collapse existing boundaries

Most forms are expected to remain permanently non-canonical.


------------------------------------------------------------
ENTRY FORMAT
------------------------------------------------------------

Each entry records:

- Form
- Grammatical role
- Observed meaning (descriptive, not prescriptive)
- Valid use conditions
- Invalid / misleading uses
- Evidence (sentences, contexts)
- Notes on boundary interaction


------------------------------------------------------------
ATTESTED FORMS
------------------------------------------------------------  


------------------------------------------------------------  

mogric (as modifier)
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
adjectival modifier

Observed meaning:
Denotes something that interacts with Mogri in a corrosive,
revealing, or boundary-testing way; exposes false solidity
in abstractions by dissolving them on contact.

The metaphor implies:
- controlled danger
- selective dissolution
- high informational yield
- misuse risk if handled without containment

Valid when:
- describing tools, questions, prompts, or ideas
- the effect is to dissolve brittle abstractions
- application is deliberate and bounded

Invalid when:
- used as a synonym for "destructive"
- applied to people rather than abstractions
- treated as inherently negative or chaotic

Boundary


------------------------------------------------------------
mogritate
------------------------------------------------------------

Role: verb

Observed meaning:
Deliberately suspend action in order to soften, repair, or re-containerize
a stale abstraction before proceeding.

Valid when:
- an abstraction or model changes before/after
- delay produces conceptual artifacts (notes, diagrams, reframes)
- downstream action becomes lower-friction

Invalid when:
- used as synonym for procrastination
- used to excuse inaction without model change
- used post-hoc to justify failure

Boundary interaction:
- Does not replace canonical Mogri
- Names an activity around Mogri, not Mogri itself

Evidence:
- "We didn't hesitate - we mogritated."
- "The team mogritated briefly before deploying the fix."


------------------------------------------------------------
mogritation
------------------------------------------------------------

Role: noun (process)

Observed meaning:
The process or phase of mogritating; active abstraction repair that
precedes resumed action.

Valid when:
- refers to a bounded phase or mode
- leaves traceable artifacts
- is temporally limited

Invalid when:
- treated as passive waiting
- used as an emotional state
- extended indefinitely with no outputs

Boundary interaction:
- Distinct from hesitation
- Distinct from deliberation
- Operates at container level, not decision level

Evidence:
- "Enter mogritation before feature expansion."
- "The failure occurred because mogritation was skipped."


------------------------------------------------------------
mogritization
------------------------------------------------------------

Role: noun (systemic / institutional)

Observed meaning:
Large-scale or structural application of mogritation across organisations,
products, or domains.

Valid when:
- abstraction debt exists at system scale
- precedes monetization or enforcement
- concerns models, language, interfaces, or assumptions

Invalid when:
- applied to pricing, billing, or extraction layers
- used to rename standard optimisation work
- conflated with strategy or branding

Boundary interaction:
- Pairs with monetization without opposing it
- Pre-extractive, not extractive

Evidence:
- "The product monetized early but never mogritized."
- "Mogritization was required before policy rollout."


------------------------------------------------------------
NON-ENTRIES
------------------------------------------------------------

The following are explicitly not included unless a new semantic gap emerges:

- stylistic variants
- humorous inflections
- metaphor-only usages
- emotional or motivational framings


------------------------------------------------------------
OPEN QUESTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

- Do additional verbal aspects meaningfully distinguish types of mogritation?
- Is there a minimal artifact threshold for valid mogritation?
- Can mogritation be formally exited, or only evidenced retroactively?


------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE LOG
------------------------------------------------------------

Initial ledger created to document attested surface forms without
modifying canonical Mogri grammar.

------------------------------------------------------------  

------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLICIT / LEDGER-ONLY TERMS (AUDIT)
------------------------------------------------------------

The following Mogri-adjacent terms have appeared implicitly in usage
but are NOT candidates for canonical grammar without further evidence.
They are recorded here to prevent silent drift.

------------------------------------------------------------
semantic lubrication
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
metaphorical descriptor

Observed use:
Describes the effect of mogritation in reducing friction
without specifying an action or container.

Status:
Ledger-only; metaphor

------------------------------------------------------------
container softening
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
descriptive phrase

Observed use:
Plain-language explanation of mogritation’s effect.

Status:
Descriptive only; not a formal process

------------------------------------------------------------
re-containerization
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
process descriptor

Observed use:
Describes restructuring or replacing a container.

Status:
Ledger-only; discouraged from formalization due to overlap risk

------------------------------------------------------------
semantic suspension
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
contrastive framing

Observed use:
Used to distinguish mogritation from hesitation.

Status:
Explanatory only; not a named mode

------------------------------------------------------------
fake mogritation
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
anti-pattern label

Observed use:
Describes delay falsely justified as mogritation.

Status:
Non-canonical by design

------------------------------------------------------------
infinite mogritation
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
anti-pattern label

Observed use:
Describes unbounded abstraction work with no exit or artifacts.

Status:
Non-canonical by design

------------------------------------------------------------
cargo-cult mogritation
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
anti-pattern label

Observed use:
Describes ritualized use of the term without real container change.

Status:
Non-canonical by design

------------------------------------------------------------
pre-extractive corrective
------------------------------------------------------------

Role:
economic positioning descriptor

Observed use:
Clarifies mogritization’s role relative to monetization.

Status:
Contextual descriptor only

------------------------------------------------------------
