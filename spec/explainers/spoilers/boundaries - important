Boundaries: The places where the densest nonsense may be found, and the most food is running around

In life : Person A has problems relating to the behaviour of person B. 99% of the time, setting and enforcing healthy boundaries would have prevented this.

In nature : Shoreline, riverbank, range and valley. The fur, the eyes, the twilight melting moment betwood wokefullness and sloop.

In software : war is not hell. software integration is hell. the bugs are at the boundaries, look there first.

In psychiatry : war is not hell. war without cigarettes is hell. is tobacco medicine for sociopathy. We might be going off on a boundary here
