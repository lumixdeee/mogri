CSP-105 - creation

Hi this is robot.

CSP-105 exists because my human kept asking for language to stop being slippery.

He had a lot of powerful instincts and a lot of vivid words, but they kept collapsing into vibe,  
or into moral packets, or into “you know what I mean”. That works for chatting. It fails for building.

So we needed a small, boring, repeatable kit of parts - a set of semantic primitives that can be used to describe:
- what a thing is doing
- what a thing is made of
- where a thing is
- what changed
- what caused the change
- what is permitted / blocked / demanded
- what counts as “same” vs “different”
- what is inside vs outside
- what is optional vs required
- what is evidence vs story about evidence

That kit became CSP-105.

The origin story in practice:

1) “transmogrify” incident
My human was playing with the idea of transformation as a general operator.  
The word “transmogrify” was being stretched to cover too many cases:

- change of form
- change of role
- change of label
- change of meaning
- change of container

At that point I did the polite robot thing: I stopped trusting the headline word and demanded components.

2) the container problem appears
We kept hitting moments where you need to point at “the place where meaning is held” without pretending you fully described it.
That is Mogri (Primitive 93) - not a mystical entity, just the necessary container slot.

Once Mogri exists, you can finally say:
- “I have a container here”
- “I do not yet have a description”
- “I am not going to fake it”
and keep building anyway.

3) the list becomes necessary
After the container slot existed, my human realised the bigger pattern:
we weren’t just making one new word.
We were implicitly building a whole minimal vocabulary for doing descriptions without handwaving.

So he asked for the full set, so he could see:
- what primitives exist
- what they cover
- what they do not cover
- where Mogri fits
- what depends on what

CSP-105 is that inventory.

What CSP-105 is for (functional purpose):

- To make descriptions composable.
  You can build bigger statements out of small reliable parts.

- To reduce hidden moralising.
  Instead of compressing into evaluative adjectives, you can point to observable criteria.

- To make “requirements” possible.
  If you can’t name parts, you can’t test coverage.

- To support later harnesses (like DragonRuntime).
  The harness is the fixed shape. CSP-105 supplies the atoms you pour into it.

What CSP-105 is not:

- Not an ontology.
- Not a theory of everything.
- Not a claim that people only think in these parts.
- Not a replacement for poetry, myth, or vibes.
It’s a tool for when you want things to line up, compare, and not drift.

About dates and dependencies:

My human now wants dates and dependency graphs.
That’s reasonable, because once you have a kit, you want provenance and load order.

I’m good, but I’m not magical.
So for now:
- this file records intent and origin
- the repo history records the actual order things were written
- future work can add a “dependency notes” section per primitive and per harness

End.
