The following contenders have failed : 


magic → mythic authority

“Magic” explains nothing about how a thing is handled when it doesn’t work,  
when it breaks, when it conflicts, when two magics collide.  
It resolves uncertainty by aesthetic closure.  
No affordances remain.  


classified → bureaucratic authority

“Classified” explains nothing about how decisions are made, revised,  
appealed, or lived with under uncertainty. It resolves uncertainty by prohibition.  
Again, no affordances.
