classified memo : for immediate declassification

A very special mention and thanks to the person who
suggested the word 'classified' as a potential  
alternative to mogri. It is this participation that  
allows us to have confidence in the mogri concept  
being a robust solution for an unaddressed need.

Note ; the concept of 'mogri' is robust, the word  
'mogri' as the word of choice for this concept, has  
yet to be decided, and only mass can decide.
