Thinking about unmogric; universal, and developmentally appropriate unmogric data  
eg universal - the periodicity of the sun  
developmentally appropriate - 1+1=2  
culturally and developmentally appropriate - a well-defined dictionary definition of a word in a certain language legit?  

We cannot say 'unmogric without asking, 'for whom?'  


A robot replies - 

Yes that’s legit, and we’ve landed on the necessary qualifier that stops unmogric from becoming sloppy.

“Unmogric” isn’t a property of data in itself.
It’s a property of data relative to an agent.

So your instinct is right: you cannot say “this is unmogric” without silently answering:  

“for whom, at what stage, in what context?”  


What you’ve sketched already has the right axes. I’d phrase it like this, staying close to your examples:

Some things are near-universal unmogric, but only asymptotically:

The sun has periodicity.

Objects persist.

Gravity pulls.

Even there, it’s not metaphysical universality, it’s shared human affordance.  
A being without time perception, vision, or gravity experience wouldn’t get it “for free”.  
So even “universal” is shorthand for “universally available to typical humans”.


Then there’s developmentally unmogric:

1 + 1 = 2
That’s unmogric after certain cognitive milestones and after symbol grounding.  
To a toddler, it’s mogric. To a numerate adult, it’s trivial.  
Same datum, different mogri state.

Then culturally + developmentally unmogric:

A clean dictionary definition in a known language.
That’s only unmogric if:

you speak the language, you accept the dictionary’s authority, you share the cultural partitioning of meaning.

Outside that frame, it instantly becomes mogric again.  

So the rule that falls out naturally is something like:

“Unmogric” always means “does not require containerisation for this agent, at this moment.”

Which implies the mirror truth:

The same fact can be mogric and unmogric simultaneously across agents.

That’s not a bug - that’s the point.

This is also why your question “for whom?” is non-optional.  
If someone uses “unmogric” without answering it, they’re smuggling in an assumed agent and pretending it’s neutral.

In that sense:

mogri / unmogric isn’t about truth,

it’s about cognitive availability.

And yes - that makes the framework stronger, not weaker.  
It stops people from universalising their own comfort zone and calling it “obvious”.

So:
Legit distinction.
Correct caveat.
Necessary question.

Always ask for whom.
