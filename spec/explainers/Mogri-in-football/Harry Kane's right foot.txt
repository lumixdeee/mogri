Harry Kane's right foot - mogri is everywhere in football.

"Harry Kane's right foot works."
This is arguably fact, and is most certainly known.

However,
"How does Harry Kane's right foot work?"
is probably a question no single person can answer in entirety.

A full answer would require knowledge of:
- football at the highest level
- sports science
- biomechanics
- neurology
- physiology
- and likely several medical degrees

This gap - between
"this clearly works"
and
"no complete account is accessible"
is mogri:

missing-but-important structure that is real,
but distributed across disciplines,
tacit skill,
and context.

Football already gestures at mogri with phrases like:
"He just has it."
"You can't teach that."
"There's something about his finishing."
