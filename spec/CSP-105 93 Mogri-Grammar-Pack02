MOGRI – GRAMMAR PACK 02 (CLOSURE & COMPLETION)
STATUS: FINAL
SCOPE: This pack completes the productive grammar of mogri.
NOTE: This pack includes ONLY forms not already present in the Core Grammar Pack
      or Extended Grammar Pack 01.

------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------

Pack 02 exists to close the mogri grammar without expanding it.
It introduces only those forms required to:
- preserve semantic boundaries
- prevent misuse of existing forms
- complete aspectual coverage of low-stakes engagement

No expressive, baroque, or ornamental forms are permitted here.

------------------------------------------------------------
CANONICAL ADDITIONS (PACK 02 ONLY)
------------------------------------------------------------

mogring
  Part of speech: gerund / activity noun
  Definition:
    Low-stakes, ambient engagement with a place, activity, or system
    that is partially active or informally usable, without escalation,
    justification, or transformation.
  Constraint:
    Must not be used for situations involving identity shift,
    semantic distortion, or irreversible change.

mogried
  Part of speech: state adjective / past-participle analogue
  Definition:
    The natural completion of mogring, reached without boredom,
    irritation, dissatisfaction, or residue.
  Constraint:
    Must not be used to mean bored, annoyed, depleted, or averse.

------------------------------------------------------------
BOUNDARY STATEMENT (NORMATIVE)
------------------------------------------------------------

The forms in this pack exist solely to protect the boundary between:

- mog-  (low-stakes, ambient, non-transformative engagement)
- mogr- (epistemic distortion caused by over-explanation)

Use of mogr- forms where mog- forms apply, or vice versa,
constitutes incorrect usage.

------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE RULE (BINDING)
------------------------------------------------------------

Mogri applies only to information about processes,
never to processes themselves.

------------------------------------------------------------
EXTENSION POLICY
------------------------------------------------------------

No further forms may be added to the mogri grammar unless:
- a genuine semantic gap is demonstrated, AND
- that gap cannot be filled by existing canonical forms, AND
- the proposed form does not collapse existing boundaries.

Expressive or ornamental forms belong exclusively in Extended Pack 01.
