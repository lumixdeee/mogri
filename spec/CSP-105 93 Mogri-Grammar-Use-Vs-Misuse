MOGRI – USES & MISUSES
STATUS: INFORMATIVE (NON-NORMATIVE)
SCOPE: This document illustrates correct usage patterns and common
       misuse patterns of mogri. It introduces no new grammar,
       definitions, or rules, and does not modify any normative
       specification.

============================================================
PURPOSE
============================================================

This document exists to prevent predictable misuse of mogri that:
- is grammatically valid but semantically incorrect
- feels reasonable to new users
- is not fully captured by formal grammar or refusal lists

It is a firebreak, not an extension.

============================================================
CORRECT USES (PATTERN LEVEL)
============================================================

These are situations where mogri does real work.

1. Halting harmful over-explanation
   Mogri is correctly used to stop explanation that is actively
   degrading clarity.
   Signal: “This was clearer before more words were added.”

2. Naming distortion without assigning blame
   Mogri can be used to identify a failure mode without accusing
   speakers of bad intent, incompetence, or malice.

3. Distinguishing mystery from degradation
   Mogri is used only when explanation damages meaning.
   Mystery, opacity, or depth alone are not mogri.

4. Meta-discussion of explanations
   Mogri applies to descriptions, justifications, narratives,
   diagrams, or frameworks about processes - not to the processes
   themselves.

============================================================
COMMON MISUSES (PATTERN LEVEL)
============================================================

These errors recur even when grammar is technically correct.

1. Emotional substitution
   Using mogri to mean boredom, irritation, anxiety, or dislike.
   Why tempting: the feeling of overload resembles emotional fatigue.
   Why wrong: mogri is structural, not affective.
   Violates: scope rule (epistemic, not emotional).

2. Process misapplication
   Applying mogri directly to rituals, systems, experiences,
   or natural phenomena.
   Why tempting: processes can be messy or hard to describe.
   Why wrong: mogri applies only to information about processes.
   Violates: “maps, not territory”.

3. Casual collapse of mogr- into mog-
   Using mogri where mogring or mogried applies.
   Why tempting: both involve low-stakes disengagement.
   Why wrong: mogr- implies semantic distortion; mog- does not.
   Violates: boundary protection between mog- and mogr-.

4. Totalising use
   Claims such as “everything is mogri” or “all explanation mogrifies”.
   Why tempting: once noticed, mogri feels ubiquitous.
   Why wrong: mogri requires contrast to function.
   Violates: explanatory usefulness.

5. Disagreement masking
   Using mogri to dismiss views one simply disagrees with.
   Why tempting: mogri can halt discussion efficiently.
   Why wrong: mogri names degradation of clarity, not conflict.
   Violates: correct-use pattern 1.

============================================================
ABUSE WARNINGS (EXPLICIT)
============================================================

The following uses are prohibited in spirit, even if phrased
grammatically.

- Mogri must not be us
