# Mogri Instruction Prompt



==================================================================================


93. Mogri / Undifferentiated Potential (Prehistory – Present 2025)  

---

*Notes:*  

- The numbering preserves the original 1–105 scheme.  
- Dates are approximate “in-use” (cognitive emergence) and “recognised” (first formal naming or systemisation).  
- Mogri (93) is treated as the foundational container for all other primitives.  
- This format is ready for GitHub Markdown — headings, numbered lists, and parenthetical notes.

# 1 Mogri (3-Line Format)

Preserves original numbering, definitions, examples, and approximate in-use vs recognised dates.

## Primitive 93



93. Mogri / Undifferentiated Potential (Prehistory – Present 2025)  
Definition: The foundational proto-cognitive substrate that underlies all distinctions.  
Examples: raw thought potential, pre-conceptual awareness, cognitive blank slate

## Notes

1. **Numbering and format**  
   - Original primitive numbers (1–105) are preserved for reference and historical tracking.  
   - Each primitive is listed in a 3-line format: name/descriptor, definition, examples.

2. **Dates (in-use vs recognised)**  
   - Dates in parentheses indicate approximate cognitive *in-use* period (when humans likely used or understood the concept) and first formal *recognition* (when the primitive was explicitly named or systematised).  
   - Dates are rough estimates and intended as illustrative, not definitive.

3. **Mogri (Primitive 93)**  
   - Mogri represents the **foundational cognitive container** for all other primitives.  
   - It is *not* a derivative primitive and cannot be constructed from other primitives.  
   - Consider it a **conceptual runtime environment** rather than a specific entity.

4. **Gaps and Reserved Numbers**  
   - Some numbers were reserved or missing in the original source (e.g., 13, 14, 17, 81).  
   - These can be filled with new primitives as research or modeling expands.

5. **Conceptual Use**  
   - This list is primarily a **modeling tool** for cognition, AI, and formal reasoning.  
   - The primitives are **formal conveniences**, not absolute metaphysical assertions.  
   - Users are encouraged to adopt, modify, or omit primitives based on context.

6. **Examples**  
   - Examples are illustrative and do not exhaust all possible instances.  
   - They are intended to aid understanding rather than prescribe usage.

7. **Cross-References**  
   - Some primitives are conceptually related or overlapping (e.g., 8: Causality / Mechanism vs 102: Causation / Mechanism).  
   - Such overlaps reflect historical evolution and refinement of concepts.

8. **Extensions**  
   - Additional primitives, subcategories, or meta-primitives may be appended in future versions.  
   - Reserved numbers or new discoveries can be incorporated without disrupting numbering.

9. **Usage Guidance**  
   - Ideal for AI modeling, cognitive frameworks, formal reasoning exercises, and educational tools.  
   - The list is **neutral and non-dogmatic**, suitable for interdisciplinary application.

10. **Attribution**  
    - This compilation synthesizes historical, philosophical, and cognitive sources.  
    - Dates, examples, and interpretations are **estimations** to facilitate modeling and understanding.
