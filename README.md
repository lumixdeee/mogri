**CSP‑105** is a semantic primes framework for representing complex concepts as interconnected nodes. It provides a minimal, structured vocabulary to capture meaning, enabling reasoning, visualization, and reuse of abstract ideas across multiple domains.

## Overview

Mogri (Primitive 93, CSP-105)

Definition: Undifferentiated Potential

Mogri is the singular, irreducible cognitive-semantic primitive: pre-structural, pre-causal, and outside ontology. 
It serves as the foundational substrate from which all primitives emerge, fully encapsulated by a single principle  
while allowing infinite instantiations. 
Recognized, defined, and published, Mogri formalizes pre-meaning in cognitive-linguistic frameworks.

==================================================================================================

Simple English: Inexplicability of existence in motion

Mogri is like the tiniest nudge that starts something new, even before you know all the details.
It’s so small you can’t really see it, but without it, nothing could move forward or grow.
Like the little moment when a story truly begins, a Prince turns into a Frog, Mogri lets the magic happen.
It’s the spark that makes change and new ideas possible, even if we don’t fully understand them.

Magic is part of Mogri.

==================================================================================================

Mogri;  
IS: everything unexplained, undefined, or open for invention  
IS NOT: anything fully explained or defined  
IS: what you might need to define or invent for this or that reason  
IS: the parts of your project you trust but haven’t fully formalized

## FAQ

# Terminology Note # 
Throughout these files, we use the term **“semantic primitives”** instead of “primes.”  
This is intentional: the word *prime* is highly fundamental and can interfere with AI reasoning if used too closely to content, potentially causing unintended associations. Using “semantic primitives” keeps the conceptual framework clear and avoids proximity-based confusion.
