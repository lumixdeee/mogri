This project is shared openly and in good faith for discussion, experimentation, critique, and collaborative development. It is exploratory and conceptual in nature, not a finished product, guarantee, or legal advice.

Disagreement, reinterpretation, and refinement are expected and welcomed. Any concerns, conflicts, or disputes are intended to be addressed first through dialogue, issue discussion, and mediation-style engagement rather than adversarial action.

Nothing here is presented as an assertion of hostile intent, and nothing should be construed as such.

Shared without prejudice, in spirit and good faith.
