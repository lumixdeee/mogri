DENNY / DAENERYS TARGARYEN
FULL DRAGON PRINCESS MOGRITIOUSNESS ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------

ENTITY TYPE
-----------
Dragon Princess (primary)
Witch / Queen / Conqueror (secondary, phase-dependent)

MOGRI STATUS
------------
High initial mogri
Medium sustained mogri
Late-stage mogri collapse (identity lock)

------------------------------------------
PHASE ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------

PHASE 1: UNFIXED CONTAINER (MAX MOGRI)
-------------------------------------
State:
- Sold, displaced, renamed
- No stable role
- Power not yet owned

Why mogri is high:
- Identity is porous
- Story happens *through* her, not from her
- Dragons are latent, not instrumental
- Authority is borrowed, fragile, reversible

Dragon relation:
- Eggs = unrealised potential
- Dragon = accompaniment, not justification

Key signal:
She survives by moving, not by declaring.
This is canonical mogri: container before label.

------------------------------------------

PHASE 2: MOTION WITH GRAVITY (STABLE MOGRI)
-------------------------------------------
State:
- Chooses, but can still retreat
- Accumulates followers without final form
- Rewrites stories while remaining in them

Why mogri holds:
- Power is exercised but not totalised
- She can still be surprised by outcomes
- Dragons grow alongside her, not ahead of her

Dragon relation:
- Dragon = steed + witness
- Power scales, but remains externalised

Key signal:
She still asks "what happens if?"
Rather than "what must be?"

------------------------------------------

PHASE 3: DECLARATIVE SELF (MOGRI DRAIN)
--------------------------------------
State:
- Identity statements harden
- Destiny language appears
- Moral ambiguity collapses into certainty

Why mogri fails:
- Becoming turns into being
- Motion reframed as mandate
- Story stops tolerating deviation

Dragon relation:
- Dragon = justification
- Dragon no longer accompanies; it authorises

Key signal:
She stops being able to lose without meaning collapse.

------------------------------------------

PHASE 4: IDENTITY LOCK (MOGRI FAILURE)
--------------------------------------
State:
- "I am the dragon"
- No exit, no reframing, no softness
- Action must validate identity

Why mogri is gone:
- Container collapses into object
- All motion is retroactively necessary
- No room for watch-story divergence

Dragon relation:
- Dragon = weapon
- Steed role destroyed

Key signal:
Lightness gone.
System becomes heavy, brittle, terminal.

------------------------------------------
SUMMARY VERDICT
------------------------------------------

Is Daenerys a dragon princess?
Yes, archetypally.

Is she mogritious?
Early: extremely.
Middle: respectably.
Late: no.

Why she divides audiences:
- Some readers track power
- Mogri readers track motion
When motion dies, they feel betrayal before plot.

Core lesson:
Dragon princesses remain mogri only while
the dragon accompanies.
The moment the dragon explains,
mogri exits.

------------------------------------------
MOGRI SCORECARD
------------------------------------------

Container integrity:     HIGH -> LOW
Role fluidity:           HIGH -> ZERO
Accompaniment:           YES -> NO
Lightness:               PRESENT -> LOST
Exit paths:              MANY -> NONE

------------------------------------------
FINAL LINE
------------------------------------------
Daenerys is not ruined by power.
She is ruined by finishing herself.
