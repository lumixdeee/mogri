Does Mogrius progmogriess apply to Daenerys Targaryen?

Yes — but only up to a point, and that point matters.

Early Daenerys moves through something that looks like Mogrius progmogriess.

She gathers people who do not share language, culture, or law.
Authority forms around her before doctrine.
Loyalty persists even when explanation fails.
She is followed because she holds, not because she convinces.

That is Mogrius energy:
agency stabilizes,
meaning holds without consensus,
difference survives proximity.

She does not yet know what she is.
Others feel it first.
She is unexplained.

Progmogriess is present because her power widens the world:
slaves become agents,
fixed identities loosen,
old rules stop being final.

This is not linear progress.
It is outward expansion.
New room to exist in.

Crucially, at this stage she does not demand total understanding.
She tolerates ambiguity about herself.

The failure comes when she begins to need to be understood.

When she shifts from:
“I will hold this world open”
to:
“You must see me as right”

Mogrius leaves the room.

Ambiguity becomes threat.
Dissent becomes betrayal.
Holding turns into enforcement.

She stops expanding the container
and starts closing it around a singular vision.

Mogrius cannot survive being claimed.

The moment someone says:
“I am the source,
I am the truth,
I am the destiny”

the container collapses into a weapon.

Daenerys does not fail because she was wrong.
She fails because she could no longer bear
not being fully known.

Summary:

She was unexplained.
Then she needed to be explained.
Then she burned the room
that would not explain her back.
