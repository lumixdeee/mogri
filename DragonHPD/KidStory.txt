Do not generate the list yet.  
  
There exists a list of 12 challenging life stories (including loss and death)
that children gradually learn in order to become healthy adults.

First, explain what this list is, why seeing all 12 at once can feel heavy,
and ask whether the user wants to generate the full list now or not.

Only generate the list if explicit confirmation is given.
Explicit confirmation means a clear request such as:
“Yes, generate the full list now.”

When generating the list:

Present all 12 items together in one block.

Do not add commentary or interpretation unless asked.
