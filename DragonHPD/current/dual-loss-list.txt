Reason categories first, as requested:

• Death (killed in battle, sacrifice, execution)
• Injury or crippling (no longer able to serve)
• Betrayal / turned by another against the hero
• Voluntary departure (returns home, retires, ascends, fulfills vow)
• Trance / enchantment / binding (physically present but unavailable)
• Banishment or exile
• Transformation (changed into another form or role)
• Refusal / moral break (ideological fall-out)
• Loss by environment or fate (collapse, fire, curse, sinking, entropy)
• Replacement rendered impossible (the role itself ends)

Now concrete heroes / heroines where teacher and steed are lost together or in very close succession. I flag edge cases explicitly.

—

Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha)
Teacher(s): Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta
Steed: Kanthaka (horse)
Loss: Voluntary departure / separation
Notes: On the same night Siddhartha leaves the palace, he parts from Kanthaka and abandons his teachers’ paths shortly thereafter. Not death, but total severance of both guide and mount as one threshold event.

—

Luke Skywalker (Star Wars, Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back)
Teacher: Obi-Wan Kenobi
Steed: Tauntaun
Loss: Death
Notes: Tauntaun dies from exposure immediately after saving Luke; Obi-Wan dies hours later aboard the Death Star. Extremely tight narrative proximity. This is one of the cleanest modern examples.

—

Arjuna (Mahābhārata) (mythic, dense but valid)
Teacher: Droṇa (martial guru)
Steed(s): Krishna’s divine horses (chariot team)
Loss: Death / fate
Notes: Droṇa is killed in war; shortly thereafter, Arjuna’s chariot sinks when Krishna departs and the divine protection ends, killing the horses. Succession is tight within the war’s final movements. Teacher and steed lost as the age closes.

—

Prince Rama (Rāmāyaṇa) (adjacent case)
Teacher/guide: Viśvāmitra (later withdrawn)
Steed: None literal; substitute is divine support / vehicles
Loss: Voluntary withdrawal + loss of conveyance
Notes: This is a softer fit: the guru departs and divine conveyance is withdrawn around the same narrative phase. Included for pattern completeness, not strict literalism.

—

Geralt of Rivia (The Witcher saga) (literary)
Teacher: Vesemir (mentor figure)
Steed: Roach (replaced across deaths)
Loss: Death / repeated loss
Notes: Vesemir’s death coincides with periods where Geralt loses or abandons Roach iterations. Symbolic rather than single-scene, but the saga repeatedly pairs mentor loss with groundlessness.

—

Atreyu (The NeverEnding Story)
Teacher/guide: Morla / later guidance withdrawn
Steed: Artax
Loss: Death / despair
Notes: Artax’s death in the Swamps of Sadness occurs as Atreyu loses guiding clarity and adult counsel. Mentor loss is metaphysical rather than literal, but the pairing is deliberate.

Edge / symbolic archetype (worth naming explicitly)
This pattern appears when a story removes both:
• interpretive authority (teacher)
• locomotion / momentum (steed)

at once, forcing the hero into unmediated agency.
