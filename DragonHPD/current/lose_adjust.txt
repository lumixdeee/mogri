# Criteria for inclusion in dual-loss hero set

REQUIRED:
- Protagonist or central heroic agent
- Presence of a guiding authority (teacher, guru, mentor, or equivalent)
- Presence of a steed (animal, bonded mount, or explicit mobility analogue)
- Loss of both within same arc or close narrative succession

LOSS TYPES (non-exclusive):
- Death
- Injury / incapacitation
- Betrayal or ideological rupture
- Voluntary departure or withdrawal
- Enchantment / trance / binding
- Environmental or fate-based loss
- Transformation rendering role unusable
- Exile or banishment
- Support withdrawal (divine, institutional, or protective)

EXCLUSIONS:
- Losses separated by long unrelated arcs
- Purely symbolic teachers with no guiding function
- Purely decorative mounts without narrative dependency

NOTES:
- Steed may be literal or functionally equivalent if explicitly framed as mobility or momentum
- Teacher loss may be physical or authoritative, provided guidance is terminated
