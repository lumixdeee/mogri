# Story Domains Covered by the Framework

This document enumerates story domains understood by the framework.
A *story domain* is any medium or state in which meaning unfolds across time,
whether internally generated, externally mediated, embodied, symbolic, or interactive.

The framework does not claim ownership of these domains.
It provides lenses and tools that may be applied where useful.

---

## I. Internally Generated (Minimal External Mediation)

- Sleeping dreams
- Hypnagogic imagery (sleep onset)
- Hypnopompic imagery (sleep exit)
- Waking dreams
  - spontaneous (reverie, daydream)
  - induced (ritual, breath, rhythm)
  - pharmacological
  - manic / ecstatic
  - traumatic / stress-induced
- Memory replay (episodic recall)
- Imagination / fantasy
- Mental rehearsal
- Intrusive imagery
- Flashbacks
- Hallucination (any cause)
- Lucid dreaming (sleep-gated, control-restored)
- Mood and affective fields (non-symbolic but meaning-bearing)

# Domains Explicitly Out of Interfacing Scope

The following are **valid semantic domains**, but the framework does not
directly interface with them. These domains are constrained, deterministic,
or optimised for correctness rather than meaning.

The framework may describe, document, or metaphorically reference them,
but does not claim operational authority within them.

---

## A. Purely Mechanical Domains

- Arithmetic
- Logic proofs
- Checksums
- Cryptographic primitives
- Hashing and encoding primitives

---

## B. Fully Constrained and Deterministic Systems

- Low-level protocols
- Signal encoding specifications
- Clocked systems
- State machines
- Hardware timing and sequencing
- Formal grammars used as execution constraints

---

## C. Precision-First Verification Domains

- Measurement and calibration
- Timing analysis
- Formal verification
- Safety-critical validation
- Proof systems where ambiguity is an error

---

These domains are respected, not absorbed.

Bridges, visualisations, metaphors, and educational layers may exist
as optional, downstream work, but correctness sovereignty remains local.
