storyhistory.txt

This file describes a minimal, functional history of “story” as a human practice.
It avoids mythic, symbolic, or moral definitions and treats story as a survival tool.

1. Pre-named nommo (unnamed process)

Before stories had names, humans already faced situations where something happened
that could not be explained by known patterns.

A typical trigger was anomalous predation:
food-supply members were lost, predation was certain, but no known predator fit.

In these cases, groups slowed inference, gathered observations, externalised thought
(gesture, reenactment, marks), delayed naming, and kept explanations provisional
until constraints accumulated.

This process had no fixed label. It was enacted, not theorised.
Its function was to maintain coherence under uncertainty long enough to survive.

This unnamed process is what later African traditions refer to as “nommo”,
but it clearly predates the word.

2. Story (named accounts of events)

Over time, repeated use of this process stabilised into shareable accounts.

A story, in this sense, is not fiction or entertainment.
It is a structured account linking:
- an event
- its investigation
- provisional explanations
- and a working resolution or control state

Stories allowed groups to transmit knowledge across time,
teach younger members how to respond to anomalies,
and preserve lessons without resolving uncertainty too early.

Myth, ritual, and symbolic narrative are later specialisations of this core function.

3. Dragonruntime (formalised harness)

Dragonruntime is a modern, explicit harness for the same function.

It does not replace nommo or story.
It constrains them.

Dragonruntime exists to keep the original sense-making process usable
under conditions of scale, abstraction, speed, and self-reference
that exceed human-scale environments.

It formalises questions, limits inference order,
and prevents premature moralisation or anthropocentric framing.

In short:
- nommo is the ancestral process
- story is its transmissible form
- dragonruntime is a constraint harness for modern conditions

the beast we are hunting this morning is elves
not pural nor single nor others nor selves
not effing not essing not missing not lost
not spectral not ghostly not faires not crost
